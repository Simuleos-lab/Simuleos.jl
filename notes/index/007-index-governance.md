## Index Governance

- The index stores only high-signal steering constraints.
- Keep implementation details and temporary tactics in live/archive notes.
- Agents can discover and propose; human maintainer decides what becomes canonical.
- Prefer updating an existing note over creating a new one unless discoverability improves.
- Keep notes short and scannable.
- Remove or archive stale blocks instead of accumulating low-value detail.
