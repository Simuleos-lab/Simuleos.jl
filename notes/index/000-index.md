## What Is The Index
- The index is the project’s compact knowledge map under `notes/index/`.
- It captures stable, high-impact design constraints.
- It focuses on user-layer interface and core architectural principles.
- It is for orientation and decision support, not for transient logs or micro-decisions.
- Each note should stay short, explicit, and easy to scan.
- If a decision becomes implementation-level, move it to live/archive notes.
