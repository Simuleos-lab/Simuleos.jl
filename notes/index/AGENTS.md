## What Is The Index
- The index is the project’s compact knowledge map under `notes/index/`.
- It captures stable architecture/workflow decisions, invariants, and conventions that guide implementation.
- It is for orientation and decision support, not for transient task logs or brainstorming drafts.
- Each index file should have a clear scope and remain concise, explicit, and scannable.
- Prefer updating an existing index note when the topic already has a home; add new files only when needed.
- The index is a reference layer for humans and agents to reduce ambiguity and avoid duplicated decisions.
- The index is for reading, not writing; it should be updated only by human maintainers.
