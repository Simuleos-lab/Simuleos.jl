    - synonimum of backend polymorphism

- #QUESTION
- Which parts of a typical ContextRecorder should have a pluggable architecture.
    - Simuleos?


## Storage Backends

- The Tara Project do not enforce and specific storage backends
- It will enforce some format directives and interfaces
- For instance, Simuleos should provide a base storage backend
    - A LiteTape for instance
- But, it is recommended that user can select and change the storage backends
